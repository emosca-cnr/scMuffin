Description: scMuffin provides functions to calculate a series of qualitative and quantitative scores, such as: expression of markers for normal and tumor conditions, pathway activity, cell hierarchy, multipotency state, copy number variations and cell cycle state. Cell-level scores are used for cell cluster annotation and combined to obtain alternative cell clusters. scMuffin integrates any type of cell- or cluster-associated data, and can be used for single-cell multi-omics analyses (e.g. mutations, gene expression).
