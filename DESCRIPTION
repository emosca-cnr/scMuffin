Description: scMuffin provides functions to calculate a series of qualitative and quantitative scores, such as: expression of marker sets for normal and tumor conditions, pathway activity, cell state trajectories, CNV, chromatin state and proliferation state. scMuffin facilitates the combination of  various cell-level evidences that used to highlight subtle cell-cell similarities, distinguish normal and tumoral cells, define cell identities, obtain alternative clusterings and link genomic aberrations with phenotypes.
