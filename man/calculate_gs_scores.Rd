\arguments{
\item{scMuffinList}{scMuffinList object}

\item{gs_list}{list of gene sets}

\item{mc.cores}{number of cores}

\item{nbins}{number of bins to split the distribution of average gene expression}

\item{nmark_min}{numner of minimum markers that are required for the succesful calculation of a gene set score}

\item{ncells_min}{numner of minimum cells in which a gene set has to be succesfully calculated}

\item{k}{number of permutations}

\item{kmin}{minimum number of permutations; due to missing values it is hard to ensure that a gene set score can be compared to k permutations in every cell}

\item{score_type}{type of score. if "relative", than the score is the difference between the observed gene set average expression and that of a k permutations; if "mean" the score is equal to the observed gene set average expression}

\item{null_model}{TRUE if permutations have to be used. Required for score_type="relative"}

\item{verbose}{verbosity}

\item{na.rm}{whether to use NA or not}

\item{overwrite}{whether to update or not gene_set_scoring and gene_set_scoring_full elements of scMuffinList.}
}
\value{
scMuffinList with elements gene_set_scoring and gene_set_scoring_full added or updated.
}
\description{
